Step 1
======

The webservice has en entry point at /checkout and it waits for a json array of products (list of strings).
An unknown product is ignored (the total doesn't change in this case).

You can query the webservice using the following curl command :

curl --include --request GET --header "Content-type: application/json" --data '["apple", "orange"]' http://localhost:9000/checkout

You should get back the following json

{"status":"OK", "total": 0.85}


Or you can check that an unknown product is ignored :

curl --include --request GET --header "Content-type: application/json" --data '["apple", "oranges"]' http://localhost:9000/checkout

You should get back the following json

{"status":"OK", "total": 0.60}


Or you can check for offers :

curl --include --request GET --header "Content-type: application/json" --data '["apple", "orange", "apple", "orange", "apple", "orange"]' http://localhost:9000/checkout

You should get back the following json

{"status":"OK", "total": 1.70}
